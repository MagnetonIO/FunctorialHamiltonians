# Functorial Hamiltonians â€“ Bulk-Surface Dynamics with Derived Hamiltonians  
This project models reaction-diffusion systems coupled with surface-bound biochemical reactions. Using finite element analysis (FEniCS) and JAX-based derived Hamiltonians, the model introduces curvature corrections and higher-order energy perturbations to simulate complex cellular environments.

## Features  
- **Bulk-Surface Coupling:** Simulates biochemical transport across bulk domains and curved surfaces.  
- **Derived Hamiltonians:** Implements higher-order corrections to surface transport dynamics.  
- **Finite Element Analysis (FEniCS):** Models diffusion and reactions on complex geometries.  
- **Docker Integration:** Provides reproducible environments for simulations.
